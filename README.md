This generator is opinionated. It sums up the current state of my understanding of AngularJS best practices and patterns in an enterprise level project.

These opinions of mine cover various aspects like –but not limited to:

* Directory layout
* Naming conventions
* Grunt over Gulp, Less over SASS
* When to use a service or a factory
* The minimum usually required Bower packages
* How to separate a development workflow from a production build
* Unit testing

I like it, It works pretty fine for me. Here's hoping it'll work for
someone else, too.

Also, I'll keep on updating it as long as I keep working with Angular. So, if you feel like contributing or even discussing with me about improvements or why I'm wrong in your opinion, be my guest.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the generated AngularJS application, you'll need Grunt and Bower.

```bash
npm install -g bower grunt-cli
```

## Install

This is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator, so installing it is a matter of having Yeoman installed:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Then install the generator itself:

```bash
npm install -g generator-angular-trumbitta
```

## Use the generator

Again, just like every other Yeoman generator, you use it like this:

```bash
mkdir <yourappname> && cd <yourappname>
yo angular-trumbitta
```

You'll be asked some questions:

1. A name for your app (all lowercase, no spaces, no special characters)  
Examples:  
**[OK]** robotcrasher  
**[KO]** suPer Awesome Robot-Crasher!
2. A description (try to be meaningful, while using less than 10-15 words)  
Examples:  
**[OK]** A robot crashing app with Spaceship integrations  
**[OK]** A robot crashing app  
**[KO]** app
3. Your full name (e.g. John Smith)
4. Your email address

The generator will then proceed to run `npm install` and `bower install` for you. If either command fails, just try running it by yourself.

This step could take a while, depending on your connection speed, because involves downloading a couple heavyweight packages. Notable *offenders* are PhantomJS and Bootstrap.

The good news is that you're going to need this done the first time only.

When it's done, launch your newly created angular application to make sure everything worked out as expected:

```bash
grunt serve
```

Then point your browser at `http://localhost:9100` just to be greeted by the underwhelming *Hello world* default page.

Hit `ctrl c` if you want to stop it.

### Sub-generators

#### resourceFactory

A resource factory is a factory whose only purpose is to let you access a REST entry point / URL.

Go where you want the new resource factory to be created, then:

`$ yo angular-trumbitta:resourceFactory myFactoryName`

The factory name argument is optional. If it's not supplied, Yeoman will ask you for it.

#### directive

The generator wants you to write a thin directive, but it really works for anything else.

Go where you want the new directive to be created, then:

`$ yo angular-trumbitta:directive myDirectiveName`

The directive name argument is optional. If it's not supplied, Yeoman will ask you for it.

## Use the generated application

### TL;DR

1. `grunt serve`
2. Hack away while grunt watches for changes together with LiveReload
3. `grunt dist` (Or `grunt dist-package` to create a packaged build in `tmp/build`) when you are ready to deploy

*Or*, you could keep on reading and get some useful insights on how this whole thing actually works.

### Directory layout

A freshly created app will sport this directory layout:

```

```

#### Notable entries

* Linting / coding style support with JSHint, JSCS, and EditorConfig config files
* Source files for your app resides inside `app`. There you can find two main files, `app.module.js` and `app.routes.js`, and two main directories: `components` and `shared`.
  * `app.module.js` is for the main app module (you don't say), and for any *run* or *config* block you may need.
  * `app.routes.js` is where you configure `ui.router` routes, interceptors, and so on
  * `components` is the directory where you put source files of things that can be organized in logical blocks a.k.a. *components*. One sample block, `home`, comes with the generator and as you can see it contains every part of the `home` component: a controller, a controller spec file for unit testing, and a template.
  * `shared` is where you put source files of things you plan to reuse on application-wide basis. Some custom directives, filters, general purpose services (e.g. a pagination service) usually reside here.  
  In `shared/config`, besides the configuration file for the Karma test runner, you'll find two configuration files for your app.
* `assets` contains assets like images and Less files. Customize your Bootstrap build by editing `assets/less/bootstrap/overrides`, organize your custom Less classes and imports using `assets/less/app-custom.less` as a starting point.

### Development

The generated app is ready for TDD. Here's a typical development cycle:

1. `grunt serve`
2. (If working on feature requiring JS code) Create / edit a spec file, the watcher launches the test suite, sends a LiveReload message, then keeps watching for modifications
3. Create / edit a JS / Less / HTML template file, the watcher does its thing again
4. Repeat 2. and 3. ad libitum
5. `ctrl c` to stop the *{watch|serv}er*

**Caveat:** the watcher doesn't react to newly created files, meaning you'll have to manually stop and restart the cycle for it to start watching over new files.

#### Naming conventions

The Gruntfile and Karma config expect you to follow some naming conventions.

##### Files

* `xyz.controller.js` for controllers
* `xyz.factory.js` for factories
* `xyz.service.js` for services
* and so on for *filters*, *directives*, *interceptors*, etc
* `xyz.{controller|factory|service|filter|...}.spec.js` for spec files
* `xyz.template.html` for templates

**Example: a component**  
```
app
└── components
    └── home
        ├── home.controller.js
        ├── home.controller.spec.js
        └── home.template.html
```

**Example: a custom directive**  
```
app
└── shared
    └── directives
        └── my-custom-directive
            ├── my-custom-directive.directive.js
            ├── my-custom-directive.directive.spec.js
            └── my-custom-directive.directive.template.html
```

##### Modules

Every controller, factory, etc. should be kept into its own module. Such module should:
* Start with `app`
* Continue with a proper plural group (e.g. `controllers`, `filters`, `services`, and so on)
* Be all lowercase

**Example: a controller**  
```js
angular.module('app.controllers.home', [])

	.controller('homeController', function() {
	  // stuff
	});
```

**Example: a service**  
```js
angular.module('app.services.batman', [])

  .service('batmanService', function() {
		// stuff
	});
```

Modules can be then injected as needed.

**Example: a controller depending on a service**  
```js
angular.module('app.controllers.mycontroller', [
  'app.services.batman'
  ])

  .controller('myController', function(batmanService) {
		// stuff
	});
```

##### Everything except directives

Be clear, not concise. Use the *type of Angular thing* in the thing's name (but not in the thing's module name).

* `someController`, `app.controllers.some`
* `oneSpecialService`, `app.services.onespecial`
* `heyLookAThreeHeadedFactory`, `app.factories.heylookathreeheaded`
* ...

##### Directives

Directives are, IIRC, the only *Angular thing* without their type in their name.

**Example**: `myCrazyProgressBar`, `app.directives.mycrazyprogressbar`

#### Adding new libraries

Third-party libraries / packages / modules are supposed to come from Bower or npm. I didn't need anything else so far.

##### Adding a Bower component

* `ctrl c` to stop the *{serve|watch}er*
* `bower install --save <the-component>` or edit `bower.json` to install the component
* `grunt serve` to restart the *{serve|watch}er*

Wiredep will perform its magic and update `index.html` for you, adding proper pointers to the new `.js` and / or `.css` files.

##### Adding a node package

* `ctrl c` to stop the *{serve|watch}er*
* `npm install --save <the-package>` or edit `package.json` to install the component
* Edit `index.html` to manually add proper pointers to the new files, but stay away from the Wiredep and Usemin blocks. They are marked by comments like these:  
```html
<!-- build:css(.) styles/vendor.css -->
<!-- bower:css -->
```
* `grunt serve` to restart the *{serve|watch}er*

BTW, I consider a best practice to use Bower for libraries needed by the application you are developing, and npm for libraries needed by Grunt or any other *infrastructural* tool you might want to use.

#### i18n

The generated app has a good enough support for your i18n needs, by using the way more than good enough [angular-gettext](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/).

##### How it works

Look at this code snippet from `app.module.js`:

```js
var lang = navigator.languages ? navigator.languages[0] : (navigator.language || navigator.userLanguage);
lang = lang.substring(0,2);

gettextCatalog.setCurrentLanguage(lang);
gettextCatalog.loadRemote(ENV.I18N.BASE_URL + lang + '.json');
//
// Useful for debugging:
//
// gettextCatalog.debug = true;
// gettextCatalog.showTranslatedMarkers = true;
```

The `lang` variable gets its value from the current language of your browser (usally found under *settings / content* or something like that), and it's a two-characters language code (e.g. `en` for English, `it` for Italian).

That is then used to configure the `gettextCatalog` and make it load the right JSON file containing all your translated strings.

##### How to create to-be-translated strings

First you have to mark some strings so that angular-gettext will be able to recognize, extract, and put them inside gettext files.  
The best way to learn how to do this, is to [read about it in the official docs for angular-gettext](https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/dev-guide/annotate/).

Once you have some strings marked, stop the *{watch|serv}er* and launch `grunt nggettext_extract` to extract the strings from your code and populate –or update– the gettext files in the `po` directory.

##### How to translate strings

Then it becomes a matter of working with gettext. What *I* do is:

1. Extract the strings as explained above
Open the amazing [Poedit](https://poedit.net/)
2. If it's the first time I'm translating a given application in a given language:
  * Choose `Create a new translation`
  * Choose the `po/template.pot` gettext catalog
  * Choose the language (e.g. English)
  * Translate away and save inside `po` with the suggested filename (which is that two-characters code we saw above in [How it works](#how-it-works))
3. If I'm adding strings to a translation I already have:
	* Choose `Edit a translation`
	* Choose the `po/<two-characters code>.po` file you want to edit (leave the `.mo` ones alone)
	* This is important: choose **Catalog / Update from POT File... from the application menu**
	* Choose the `po/template.pot` catalog file
	* Translate away and save over the existing `.po` file

This will take care of the gettext part.

##### How to import translated strings back into the Angular app

You'll now have to import back the updated gettext files inside your app.

Well, there's a Grunt task for that: `grunt nggettext_compile`.  
But even better, you don't really have to manually execute it, because both `grunt serve` (you already know about it) and `grunt dist` / `grunt dist-package` (keep on reading for these two, or jump to [Production](#production)) take care of it.

Just go on as usual –for example with a `grunt serve`.  
`nggettext_compile` will also be executed, JSON files will be created or updated, and the application will load them at the next manual page refresh (LiveReload doesn't apply here).

### Documenting

ngDoc is a recent addition. **TODO description.**

### Testing

As you may already know if you read about [naming conventions](#naming-conventions) up there, spec files should be created beside the source file they are related to.

**Example: spec file for a controller**  
```
app
└── components
    └── home
        ├── home.controller.js
        ├── home.controller.spec.js
```

Unit tests get executed by the watcher whenever needed. There's also a `grunt test` task, just in case.

You'll find a test coverage report in `tmp/coverage`.

### Production

Once you are ready for a deploy or a release, it's time to *build a dist*.

* Check the *dist* version of your app's configuration in `app/shared/config/dist.config.json`
* Launch `grunt dist`

Then copy the generated –or updated– `dist` directory and use it as you most like.

Or run `grunt dist-package` to create a packaged build in `tmp/build`.

### Grunt tasks

Here's a list of the most useful grunt tasks at your disposal. The omitted ones are *internal* and *helper* tasks that you are not supposed to ever need using.

Task               |What it's for
-------------------|-------------
`serve`            |Builds and serves the development version of the app on port 9001, and watches for changes in the source files
`dist`             |Builds the production version of the app
`dist-package`     |Creates a packaged build in `tmp/build`
`nggettext_extract`|Extracts the i18n strings you chose by annotating source files, and saves them into gettext files ready to be translated
`test`             |Executes unit tests

### Configuration

**TO BE EXPANDED – help wanted**

`dev.config.json` is used in development (e.g. `grunt serve`), while `dist.config.json` is used in production (e.g. `grunt dist` and `grunt dist-package`).  
They are but stubs, samples. You are free to organize and expand on them as you wish. Their contents will be available wherever you inject `app.config` and pass the `ENV` service.  
**Example:** `var myRESTBackend = ENV.BACKEND.URL.FULL;`

## Compatible packages

I started to open source some packages I, for one, find useful in my work.  
They are a small but growing bunch of services, directives, etc, following the same opinionated practices and conventions you were so kind and patient to read about in this very guide.

None at this moment.
